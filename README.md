```

### CSV Rules:

1. Each line represents one question
2. First column: The question text
3. Next 4 columns: The answer options
4. Mark correct answers with `$` at the beginning (you can mark multiple answers as correct)
5. Use `(;)` as separators - no need to escape commas or semicolons in text
6. At least one answer must be marked as correct

- Make incorrect answers plausible but clearly wrong
- Test your CSV file with a small set first
- Use consistent formatting throughout

### Multiple Correct Answers

You can create questions with multiple correct answers by marking several options with `$`:

```csv
Which are European countries?(;)$France(;)$Germany(;)Brazil(;)$Italy
Select all even numbers?(;)$2(;)3(;)$4(;)7
Which are web browsers?(;)$Chrome(;)$Firefox(;)Photoshop(;)$Safari
```

When answering these questions, any of the marked correct answers will be accepted as correct.
